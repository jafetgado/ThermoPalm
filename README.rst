**ThermoPalm**
===============

ThermoPalm is a tool to predict protein thermostability using protein language embeddings.
Embeddings are retrieved from ProtT5-XL-Uniref50 and a ridge regression model, fitted with
melting temperature values of the Meltome Atlas dataset, is applied to predict the melting
temperatures of specified proteins.
